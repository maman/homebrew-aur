My Own Homebrew Recipe
===========

This repositories contains backported Formulae from [Archlinux AUR](http://aur.archlinux.org). currently there's not much recipe exist, but I'm trying to add more later.  

**do not expect stable things here - as I'm not testing this throughly.**

How do I install these formulae?
===========

Use `brew tap maman/my-own-homebrew` and then `brew install <formula>`.  

If the formula conflicts with mxcl's master or another tap, you can `brew install maman/my-own-brew/<formula>`.  

Also, you can install these formulae individually via URL:  

    `brew install https://raw.github.com/maman/my-own-brew/master/<formula>.rb`

Docs
===========

`brew help`, `man brew`, or consult the [Homebrew Wiki](http://wiki.github.com/mxcl/homebrew).
